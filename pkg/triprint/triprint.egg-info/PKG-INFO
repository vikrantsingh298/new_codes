Description: This package can be used for getting desired number of row star traiangle in up or down direction by giving an input for the desired number of rows.
        # Use
        For example if you want to get a 5 row star triangle in upward direction. Then you can simply code it as,
        
        import triprint
        
        triprint.pstar(5,1)
        
        # First input will give the number of rows and second input is the boolean 0 or 1, 0 for down triangle and 1 for upper triangle.
        
        # Attribute  
        pstar('Number of rows in int','0 or 1')  # For printing triangles made up of '*'
        
        phash('Number of rows in int','0 or 1')  # For printing triangles made up of '#
        
        pdoller('Number of rows in int','0 or 1')  # For printing triangles made up of '$'
        
        pat('Number of rows in int','0 or 1')  # For printing triangles made up of '@'
